@LemonAndroid cat vision-api/functions/root/handler.rb
wait the file is not done :D

it's very funny with irc not supporting multi-line messages :D
every loc is a separate message

i think your laptop will crash due to too many notifications @stefan-reich :D
i turned them off
your craptop will lash



i don't get the syntax >> GET /v1/rooms/:roomId/chatMessages?limit=50
where's the room id supposed to go?

i tried putting the room id where it says "roomId"





without the colon?

i'm asking for support here now for the vision-api integration https://faastruby.slack.com
ah, got it

yes exactly



slack is really kinda out

true, but stdlib.com is building on it for example
i also use stdlib for qanda
whole api until now is on stdlib.com
stdlib.com got 1million$ funding from stripe and slack each






build.stdlib.com was released yesterday or so

faastruby is basically stdlib in ruby



hello wurld
haha
that came from the bot
nice
can you send multi line messages?
REST API is fairly easy

for you atm :D for me it was impossible
eezee
multi
line
mama
ah nice
why impossible?
this would improve the cat thingie i built

should clearly be within your reach
because i'm too lazy

@LemonAndroid cat vision-api/functions/root/handler.rb
LOOOOOOL

it also kina proves it's a bot :D
what human could send messages that quickly
the lack of multilines does kinda suck :-D
also... no smilies?
we really need discord

argh
i enjoy gitter
it's OPEN SAUCE


ok now i can basically read & post
but i have to poll

ah, streaming API
hehe



test
ok i streaming through curl works


they do make it pretty easy
` if message.body.to_s =~ /@LemonAndroid List github repos/i
      client.privmsg("qanda-api/Lobby", "https://api.github.com/users/LemonAndroid/repos")
    end`
@stefan-reich List 10 most recently pushed to Github Repos of LemonAndroid

what now i'm the bot?
haha i wish

hehe




















sooo :D
@stefan-reich you're here?

the `google-vision-api` ruby gem can only authenticate via a `creds.json` file 
to make that work on faastruby:
i store the contents of that `creds.json` file in the `secrets.yml`

then i save it into a tempfile in the ruby function running on faastruby

like `t = Tempfile.new; t.write(context.secrets.creds_json_contents` pseudocodish
uh
and then i emulate an environment variable

street-creds.json
like `ENV['GOOGLE_VISION_API_THING_USES_THIS_VAR']=t.path`

that sounds sucky
haha yeah :D
paolo from faastruby gave me this way to do it shortly before boarding his flight
he's now in the plane

he's the founder
i know both the founders of stdlib and faastruby through slack/gitter 
like, i interacted a lot with them for a while last year



keith and steven from stdlib made tons of hackathons happen after i talked with keith about hackathon strategy
i guess the blasted a good amount of the 2 million $ funding on these hackathons

but... shouldn't he spell "fast" correctly then?
now stdlib.com has a lot of students from canada basically locked into stdlib
faast is function as a service

:-D
got it
but why the "t"?

fast i guess
i don't know if it has a meaning in the acronym

just looks better
yeah and it's fast
and it's ruby

smaller functions are way better scalable



just like small dicks

lol

sorry. is this an adult chat?

lol :D
depends
the people in here yes
it's just more open than discord

could be scraped by google for example
so i would try to keep it pg0
i like to be scraped by google. it's my secret sexual fantasy
:D

bless the children who'll read this
it's all natural

test
nice. streaming API works

hey we're ready to make gitter bots

is it easy to make multiple github accounts?



so if the bot needs a github account anyway, it can also publish its own code LOL




yeah, that's easy
awesome
can the bot clone a repo?

ah, not sure
but you can log in as the bot and do github things

just.. how to name the bot?





eezee

is that a suggestion?
you do need multiple email addresses

fucking annoyed by storing a json file as a string in a yml file and then parsing that yaml which was already converted to json and storing it in a json file :D

yeah, eezee is my suggestion
eezee is nice

but i chose another name already for this one
eeZee

i used my gmail.com address as opposed to the googlemail.com
the usual cheap tricks

ah
or username+something




Hellööö
yeah the name is lame
lmao
also it looks like me

yeah the + method might also work
nice to see working umlauts

UTF8 is the best thing that ever happened to computer science



why michael? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ybzUYIpb1I
spur of the moment

ah ok
huh, somebody claimed my old domain... https://ai1.space
well, who cares
:D

[edit] huh, somebody claimed my old domain... http://ai1.space
sofortwohnen.com is for sale
better sofort wohnen than later

well... this was productive
now i can officially offer gitter integration for bot customers





Check out my new profile pic!


so all the profile manipulation is done in github, right


so you use a ruby irc library?






love the MJ song
[edit] love that MJ song

yes, i use a ruby irc library
profile manipulation?

yeah, changing pic, bio, ...
i'm wondering if the bot can do it


i don't care about that
i do
would be nice for sure

self-empowered bots!
can i link to this page in my blog?
https://gitter.im/qanda-api/Lobby

well sure i can
lol

i don't think you can forbid me
or would, even
also it should technically be possible
so the answer is probably yes
yes ofc

...and i just did
there should be a better text though



yes i think that's acceptable

we do have one active bot and one dormant bot

who cares that one of those isn't made by me LOL
it's all about the IMAGE OF SUCCESS
project an image of success at all times

quote from the movie.......?
show me your pop culture fu

uh i dunno

nvm
american beauty
ah
love that movie
love kevin spacey

yeah, one of a kind
i don't care about the "allegations" either
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZveA-NAIDI
i'm not conforming to the peer pressure to not like someone anymore

oh that thing, yeah
it's an excellent bit
although it explains nothing









the whole kevin spacey and weinstein stories are really annoying
what do they want from them

money?
attention?
i dunno...
fucking pointless
it's a war...

the same war that doesn't get me laid probably

he made them drunk and touched them etc...
whatever
lol

yeah
stuff people do
after all
i like your view on this

anyone could have left at any point i'm sure
should they not have liked whatever was happening
like he made them drunk and touched them for one night
and now he's beeing tortured since 2 years

how do you make people drunk :D
don't they drink themselves
haha
he pretended it was alcohol-free bourbon
:D


"Das Opfer leide unter schweren mentalen und emotionalen Verletzungen. "

"Deshalb werde Spacey auf Schadensersatz verklagt, der die medizinischen und therapeutischen Kosten abdecken soll, b"
yeah, being touched hurts a lot
first one is the bank card
i'll sue all the hookers i've had



maybe they have more money than you :D
my basic gitter implementation fits on one page >> http://tinybrain.de/1023546
yeahhh... it's my ticket to riches

she... she.... TOUCHED me.... and... she TOOK MY MONEY

*sobs*
our life could be worse
we could be writing articles like this one https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/weinstein-sullivan-harvard-1.4499977
you mean she could have taken my money and NOT touched me?

for me this is all displaced anger
it's immoral to be his lawyer because he is worse than a murderer apparently
people are angry about something else

yeah it's really insane
they're poor etc...
people cut off their limbs for insurance fraud
it really is a fucked up world
yeah

problem is inequality
yes
but hey, why not pick a few artists
they're the problem!
fukcing hollywood man

non-fucking hollywood
"fucking hollywood man" *hands hooker tip 
unfucked hollyfuckingwood
"fucking hollywood monsters"
holly where's your wood?
all these gropey men

is that a word?
"why are all the cute men gay????"

"eewwww so feminine, this guy is a hetero?"
but yeah ofc, women never had power :D

women make people
i think that's a whole lot of power in itself

i know woman want more of that nice power

like being ceo, lead programmer|engineer etc

that's also pretty easy to grasp
i wish we were in paradise already
don't want to smoke cig after cig

well there is a prophecy for 2019
maybe paradise is on the menu
and somehow this is all a dejavu tho
a touch of it at least :-D
i reflected a bit on my life today
i remember writing this convo with you like it was yesterday

in a different life
it's really absurd that i don't have a running business yet
haha, actual deja vu right now?
since days/months
that mysterious feeling
i know i've been through this already

you have a deja vu since months?
maybe we're all on a flight to a planet in the far and relive a movie 

haha
for sure we are in some sort of bubble
"the veil"
i just hope it ends soon
we can't see people that are dead, but i believe they are alive somewhere

yeah, i also believe in ever-living souls
sometimes i wish i wake up
everything is normal again
i now have the ability to wake up from each and any nightmare i have

like at night
waking up from reality seems a bit tougher
it's nice, i don't really suffer nightmares anymore

i just think, hey that must be a dream, and wake up
sometimes it's not bad enough though to recognize and i keep dreaming

i always misplace bags in my dreams LOL
such a human thing to dream about

we need legal weed
now
global

yeah
@wangjess would agree i guess
today some guys said that they want to outlaw all smoking in sweden or wherever
and the guy seemed like he supported that
people are weird

yeah, i also said similar things few months ago
lemme link
https://twitter.com/Der_Derwish/status/1117340648326225920
that's prohibition
has nobody learned anything?
https://twitter.com/Der_Derwish/status/1117340648326225920

haha... du troll

"Ich will nie wieder anfangen und alles verbieten und die Verbote auch durchsetzen. Alkohol, Zigaretten und Kaffee und Narkotika etc. Alles verbieten."

people believe the nonsense you write
or did you actually believe that in that moment?

good luck making coffee illegal



ok... i'll down my antibiotics with some drugs and then go to sleep i think

very nice session with you again
apart from that last bit :-D















:D
in dem moment dachte ich das

hatte aufgehört mit allem außer kakao
aber ich merke gerade auch wieder
geht nicht
kann nicht nicht rauchen
ist halt leider so


jetzt ist da nicht mehr so viel real https://twitter.com/Der_Derwish/status/1117340648326225920














anything is possible
